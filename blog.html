                                <strong>Local Storage</strong> this read-only interface property provides access to
                                the
                                Document’s local
                                storage object, the stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
                                sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends –
                                that is when the page is closed. It is cleared when the last “private” tab of a browser
                                is closed (localStorage data for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito
                                session).
                                <br>
                                <strong>Session Storage</strong> objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage
                                read-only property. The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
                                localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page
                                session ends.

                                A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page
                                sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages are only saved for the amount of
                                time that the tab or the browser is open; they do not persist after the page reloads and
                                restores. A new session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is
                                different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with the same URL creates
                                its own sessionStorage

                            <strong>Global Scope</strong> is variables defined outside of any function or curly
                            brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the
                            variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state
                            can access that variable.<br>
                            <strong>Block Scope</strong> is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope
                            can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly
                            brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed
                            to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                            1.Map <br>
                            Map like filter & foreach takes a callback and run it against every element on the array but
                            whats makes it unique is it generate a new array based on your existing array. <br> <br>
                            2.Foreach <br>
                            Foreach takes a callback function and run that callback function on each element of array
                            one by
                            one.For every element on the array we are calling a callback which gets element & its index
                            provided by foreach.

                            Basically forEach works as a traditional for loop looping over the array and providing you
                            array
                            elements to do operations on them.<br> <br>
                            3. Filter <br>
                            The main difference between forEach and filter is that forEach just loop over the array and
                            executes the callback but filter executes the callback and check its return value. If the
                            value
                            is true element remains in the resulting array but if the return value is false the element
                            will
                            be removed for the resulting array. <br><br>
                            4.Find <br>
                            The find() method returns the value of the first element that passes a test. The find()
                            method
                            executes a function for each array element. The find() method returns undefined if no
                            elements
                            are found. The find() method does not execute the function for empty elements.
